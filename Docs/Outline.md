# Story Outline

## Prologue

This is a short introduction to the world. It has no options to choose from.

1. "Long ago, a war was waged by two nations. One, a nation of powerful warriors; the other a nation of great wizards. The armies of the nation of warriors, with their far superior numbers and better generals, easily conquered much of the territory of the nation of wizards. After tremendous losses, the wizards made their last stand in their capital's citadel."
2. "With the warriors streaming through and sacking their city, the wizards completed their final spell.The earth shook violently and the citadel was sundered as it was swallowed by the ground. When the dust settled, a terrible roar echoed across the land. Monsters erupted from the ruins and ripped and tore through the warrior armies. Thus was the first monster lair created."
3. "Though they only sought to bleed the nation of warriors, in their desperation the wizards made a mistake. Following the first lair, countless others appeared across the world, each bringing ruin to the surrounding lands. It took several generations and the combined efforts of many nations to retake the lost lands and destroy most of the lairs."
4. "Today, monsters are a normal part of life, and Ranger companies dedicated to finding and destroying lairs are ubiquitous. To ensure that their ranks are filled with the best monster slayers, many Ranger companies established academies that train young candidates."
5. "You live near one such academy, and soon you will be old enough to apply for admission. You decide to keep a journal of your time at the Ranger academy."
