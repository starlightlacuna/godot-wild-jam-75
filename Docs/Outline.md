# Story Outline

## Prologue

This is a short introduction to the world. It has no options to choose from.

1. "Long ago, a war was waged by two nations. One, a nation of powerful warriors; the other a nation of great wizards. The armies of the nation of warriors, with their far superior numbers and better generals, easily conquered much of the territory of the nation of wizards. After tremendous losses, the wizards made their last stand in their capital's citadel."
2. "With the warriors streaming through and sacking their city, the wizards completed their final spell.The earth shook violently and the citadel was sundered as it was swallowed by the ground. When the dust settled, a terrible roar echoed across the land. Monsters erupted from the ruins and ripped and tore through the warrior armies. Thus was the first monster lair created."
3. "Though they only sought to bleed the nation of warriors, in their desperation the wizards made a mistake. Following the first lair, countless others appeared across the world, each bringing ruin to the surrounding lands. It took several generations and the combined efforts of many nations to retake the lost lands and destroy most of the lairs."
4. "Today, monsters are a normal part of life. New lairs materialize seemingly every week, and Ranger companies dedicated to finding and destroying them are ubiquitous. To ensure that their ranks are filled with the best monster slayers, many Ranger companies established academies that train young candidates."
5. "You live near one such academy, and soon you will be old enough to apply for admission. You decide to keep a journal of your time at the Ranger academy."

## Day 1

The night before the ranger academy's entrance exam, The Student mentally prepares themself. They think about their rival and friend, who is also taking the exam.

The Player will make their first choices in this day. These choices will have both immediate and lasting effects through the rest of the journal entries.

1. Tomorrow's the entrance exam! I've been dreaming of this my whole life. I'm so
   1. excited! [Attitude +1]
   2. nervous... [Attitude -1]
2. {if Attitude > 0: I can't wait to go up to the proctor and flaunt my skills.} {if Attitude < 0: I hope that I don't embarrass myself in front of everyone.}
3. The other day I was at the market and saw my friend Sam. Even though we're not students yet, he's already putting in an order for an arming blade at the swordsmith! He's about the same age as me, but he's always been stronger and faster. Everyone thinks he'll be a great ranger and he's basically guaranteed to be accepted into the academy. I think he's 
   1. annoying. [Camaraderie -1]
   2. cool. [Camaraderie +1]
4. If I get accepted, we'll probably be in the same class. 
5. {if Camaraderie > 0: I'll work hard to catch up to him so our class will be the best in the academy.} {if Camaraderie < 0: I'll work hard to become better than him, so people will finally notice my skills.}
6. Anyway, I have to go to bed. The exam starts an hour after sunrise, so I need all the rest I can get!

## Day 2

The Student passed the entrance exam and was admitted into the academy. After a month of classes, they think about a few people in their class. Their friend is also in the class, and The Student has to deal with his presence.

The text presented to The Player will take on different tones depending on the choices they made in the previous journal entry.

## Day 3

The Student and their class embarked on their first expedition. They went to a small lair to clear it out with the aid of a few rangers. Something went wrong, and The Student was injured along with some of their classmates.

The Player will see the consequences of their choices in the previous days. There are few choices to make that will affect at The Student's future in the academy and possibly as a ranger.
